# Few shot solution of heterogeneous PDEs

## Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) are ubiquitous in the physical sciences and in engineering, however, very rarely these equations are solvable analytically. In most cases they are very computationally demanding and require sophisticated discretizations that render a universal algorithm inapplicable for different PDEs. In addition, even for a specific physical system described by a PDE, environmental and external factors expressed as the boundary or the source function in a PDE are constantly changing, in the traditional framework , for each such alteration , the PDE would need to be solved from scratch. Using advances in meta-learning, we introduce a Physics Informed Neural Network (PINN) approach to tackle this important scenario. We verify our method on some well known and fundamental PDEs and showcase how it can be easily applied in any task.
